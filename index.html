                This pong game is a single player "challenge mode". while it doesnt seem like much now, my next devolpment step is a counter and a local leaderboard,<br> 
                so that people can challenge their friends locally.<br>
                directions<br>
                keep the ball bouncing for as long as you can!<br>
